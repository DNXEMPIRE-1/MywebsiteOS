                <br />
                <p>
                    From a young age, I have had a curiosity about how things
                    worked. This naturally led me to become absolutely obsessed
                    with Lego and I fell in love with building things. In
                    High school, I joined the Lego Robotics team at my
                    local middle school, which was my first real exposure to
                    programming. In 2008, my family and I moved across the
                    country from California to New York, where I attended middle
                    school, high school, and college.

                    I started programming more seriously in high school,
                    initially learning how to scrape and interact with websites.
                    I went on to do a ton of passion projects, many of them with
                    one of my closest friends,{' '}

                    multiple game projects, apps, and more. One of these
                    projects is viewable on my{' '}

                    In 2017, I got accepted into Rennselear Polytechnic
                    Institute to study Computer Science. It was my first choice
                    and I was absolutely ecstatic to be going to such a great
                    university. At the end of my sophomore year, I got an
                    internship working for the startup Hover, primarily focusing
                    on frontend work. I continued to work at Hover on and off
                    for about a year and a half, until the start of my senior
                    year when I decided to focus on other opportunities.

                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have are{' '}

                            <Link to="/projects/art">Digital Art</Link>. You can
                            read more about each of these on their respective
                            pages under my projects tab. Some other hobbies I
                            enjoy are working out, cooking, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.

                            In college, I was an active member in the fraternity
                            Sigma Alpha Epsilon and held multiple positions in
                            the chapter. I met a lot of amazing people through
                            my fraternity and thoroughly enjoyed the community.
