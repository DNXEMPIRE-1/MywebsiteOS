                    dennisnzioki.com is my portfolio website, and also the
                    website you are on right now. This project was an absolute
                    joy to make and challenged me both technically and
                    creatively. Early in 2023, I knew I wanted to make an
                    interactive portfolio to aid my job search. I eventually got
                    the idea for this site around early February and began
                    development late July. I've been developing it alongside my
                    last semester at school and if you are reading this, it's
                    pretty much done!

                    3D site uses Three.js to render the scene and renders the 2D
                    site inside of it using an iframe. The 2D OS site is a

                    the 2D site is accomplished using a CSS renderer provided by
                    Three.js that transforms the html of the 2D site with 3D CSS
                    transforms to give the illusion of three dimensionality.

                    TypeRush picks a passage for you to type. As you type, it
                    keeps track of how fast and accurate you are, and how many
                    points you get. It shows mistakes clearly and warns you
                    about Caps Lock. After each round, you get a full breakdown
                    of your performance to encourage you to keep improving.

                    üìù Here's what you can do with NinjaSketch: <br></br>
                    Choose a Tool: You have pencils, lines, rectangles, and text
                    tools. Pick one and start creating. <br></br>
                    Draw and Move: Click and drag on the canvas to draw. To move
                    something, select it and drag it to a new spot. Also, resize
                    elements by dragging the corners. Resizing only works on
                    rectangles or lines. <br></br>
                    Edit Text: Click on the canvas and start typing to add text
                    to your drawings. You can also edit existing text. <br></br>
                    Zoom: Use Ctrl + Scroll or click on the buttons to zoom in
                    for detail or out to see the whole picture. <br></br>
                    Pan: Hold the Space bar and drag or use the middle mouse
                    button to move around the whiteboard canvas.

                    üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ The Process<br></br>I started by rendering a canvas with
                    rough.js to create the base for all the drawings. Then, I
                    focused on drawing on the canvas, allowing users to make
                    lines, rectangles, and other shapes. <br></br>
                    Next, I made sure users could move elements around. This was
                    important for adjusting drawings. After that, I added the
                    ability to resize elements to give more control over the
                    shapes.<br></br>
                    To make sure mistakes could be fixed, I implemented undo and
                    redo features. I also added freehand drawing for a more
                    natural sketching experience and a text tool to label or
                    note on the canvas.<br></br>
                    To navigate larger drawings, I put in pan and zoom tools.
                    With everything functioning, I designed the whole UI to make
                    it user-friendly and appealing. <br></br>
                    Finally, I added testing with Cypress and Testing Library. I
                    conducted end-to-end tests on drawing and manipulating text,
                    lines, rectangles, and freehand drawings to make sure
                    everything worked smoothly. <br></br>
                    Along the way, while building everything, I took notes on
                    what I've learned so I don't miss out on it. I also
                    documented the behind-the-scenes processes every time a
                    feature was added. <br></br>
                    This way, I understood what I've built. The funny thing is,
                    as soon as I started to document what happened behind the
                    scenes and the features I've added, it made me realize that
                    we fully understand something once we've actually taken a
                    step back, thought about it, and documented what we've done.
                    I think this is a good practice to follow when learning
                    something new.
