                    dennisnzioki.com is my portfolio website, and also the
                    website you are on right now. This project was an absolute
                    joy to make and challenged me both technically and
                    creatively. Early in 2023, I knew I wanted to make an
                    interactive portfolio to aid my job search. I eventually got
                    the idea for this site around early February and began
                    development late July. I've been developing it alongside my
                    last semester at school and if you are reading this, it's
                    pretty much done!

                    3D site uses Three.js to render the scene and renders the 2D
                    site inside of it using an iframe. The 2D OS site is a

                    and works as a standalone web app. The actual rendering of
                    the 2D site is accomplished using a CSS renderer provided by
                    Three.js that transforms the html of the 2D site with 3D CSS
                    transforms to give the illusion of three dimensionality.

                    TypeRush picks a passage for you to type. As you type, it
                    keeps track of how fast and accurate you are, and how many
                    points you get. It shows mistakes clearly and warns you
                    about Caps Lock. After each round, you get a full breakdown
                    of your performance to encourage you to keep improving.
